    "During this project, we will use the same datasets from `case.a_predictive_project_from_start_to_finish` as the foundation for the presentation. \n",

    "\n",
    "First some general tips:\n",
    "1. **Prepare for your presentation.** If you have an important meeting coming up, practice your presentation a few times by reviewing your talking points. If possible, record yourself giving the talk and rewatch the recording to identify any weak points that might appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid reading off of your presentation**. This will allow you to be more confident make you appear more knowledgeable on the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pace your slides**. Several experts put the rate of slides in a powerpoint at 1 slide every two minutes. This is not a rule set in stone but be mindful that you are not spending more than 5 minutes on one slide or changing slides every 10 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid small fonts**. Do not use font sizes under 20px in your presentations. - helps avoid putting too much content on slide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid using long paragraphs in your presentations**. The text on the slides shouldn't divide your audience's attention. Long text can make your audience have to decide between reading your slide or listening to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use images**. use images, diagrams, graphs, etc as much as possible when the subject and message suits them. Our brains comprehend visual inputs quicker, that way you let your audience's attention rest on your talk as much as possible."

    "* Keep your audience engaged. Ask them questions every set amount of time and interact with the audience. \n",
    "* Ask the attendees questions that you plan to answer, eg: ¨How do you think this behavior affected the company bottom line?¨ After the attendee's answer proceed to give a more in-depth view of the insight in the data.\n",
    "* Make sure your internet connection is stable.\n",
    "* Be sure you manage the technology and tools well enough.\n",
    "* Keep meetings short or have breaks. Distractions are more common in the online space.\n",

    "## **In-person presentations**\n",
    "* Be mindful of the attendees' behavior and try to clarify the subject if people seem especially lost.\n",
    "* Project your voice effectively.\n",
    "* Be expressive! Use your body language to help convey the ups and downs in your presentation.\n",

    "To make comparison easier between models, we can add the prediction values of other models created during the first case on the graph.\n",
